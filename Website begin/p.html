<p> HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology,
used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1]
Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. <br> <br> <!-- forced link-break -->
HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation,
 making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</p> <!-- p is when we want to separate it by paragraph-->

<p> HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
